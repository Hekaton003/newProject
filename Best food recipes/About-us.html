    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. <strong>Best food recipes</strong> is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert.</p>
    <p> The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night. Most importantly, <strong>Best food recipes</strong> connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.</p>
    <h2>Above all, we are:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Friendly</strong> We love trading ideas and hanging out with fellow home cooks. </li>
        <li><strong>Supportive</strong> Struggling with dinner inspo? We’re here to help!</li>
        <li><strong>Creative</strong> Cooking is an art. We like to experiment and express ourselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Approachable</strong> We don't judge—all cooking levels and recipes are welcome. </li>
        <li><strong>Down-to-Earth</strong> We love good food, period. It doesn’t need to be fussy to be great.</li>
        <li><strong>Fun</strong> Like you, we enjoy friends, family, cooking, and having a good laugh.</li>
